# Geopoints editor
***
An applicaton where you can create and view geopoints, provide desctiption for them, upload images, export and import from csv etc.
Consists of two pages - 'main' to view points and 'config' to create and modify them. Already populated with demo data.
Implemented on native js. Browser local/sesstion storage serves as backend.
***
The application development is in process. So codebase isn't completely consistent, i.e. some code fragments are done year ago, some just refactored. At the same time it's fully functional - available via [link](https://vp-js.neocities.org/geopoinis_editor/main.html)
